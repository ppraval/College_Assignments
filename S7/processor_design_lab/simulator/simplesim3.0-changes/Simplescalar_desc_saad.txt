Objective: converting out of order pipeline to in-order without losing functional accuracy (dump the register state to check) i.e . Identify and remove out of order exclusive stages like commit, and components like reservation station, reorder buffer, reg update unit and load-store queue and modify those components for basic inorder issue pipe with fetch, decode, execute width to 1 inst.

Simplescalar-sim

To build sim for alpha ISA, 
In simplesim-3.0 dir, 


make clean
make config-alpha
make

To build sim for pisa ISA (Similar to MIPS)

make clean
make config-pisa
make


Run some inbuilt benchmark
In simplesim-3.0

./sim-(safe/fast/outorder or any executable) (give any flag and its arg) ./tests-alpha(or pisa)/bin/(any benchmark)

Generate pipeline trace to check each stage processes only 1 instruction 

sim-outorder -ptrace filename.trc start_inst:end_inst benchmark

pipeline.pl filename.trc

Get disassembly file with each instruction and its respective PC 

../bin/sslittle-na-sstrix-objdump -ld benchmark > redirected_output.dis
