After completing Part A, you are supposed to develop a program that will monitor the Network Communication, and on seeing an established SSH communication, it has to wait for the connection to be stabilised. Once the connection is stabilised, your program has to create a TCP packet that would be accepted by the other party (Server or Client), which is taken as a option from the user. On receiving the packet at the destination, the TCP connection should be terminated.
