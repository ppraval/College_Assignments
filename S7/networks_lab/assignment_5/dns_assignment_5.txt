You are supposed to set up an Authoritative Name Server in Master Slave Mode for your organisation “NW Lab” hosted at subdomain nwlab.cse.nitc.ac.in. 
Your organisation needs two DNS Servers in Master-Slave mode, 
where one is the master in which you enter the domain entries and the other is the slave which gets updated automatically via the network from the master. 
You are not supposed to make any domain name entries in the slave name server, 
which should get updates of authoritative entries only from the master name server. 
This will be tested at the time of the demonstration. 
You should be able to register new domains in the DNS Server. Both Master and slave should be capable of resolving Domain names independently.
