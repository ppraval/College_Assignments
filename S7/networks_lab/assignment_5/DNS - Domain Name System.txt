DNS - Domain Name System
it is a distributed database that maps hostnames to IP addresses.

we have nslookup and dig

we should have a NIC and that should have an IP

we have to convert a hostname to an IP address

.com - it is called ns domain (name server domain)

we have top level root Servers

we have another set of NS servers

we have authoritative servers
which have the authoritative mapping

for example if we want the yahoo.com's ip address it has to be in the authoritative dns server


Recursive resolution is the process of a DNS server querying other DNS servers on behalf of a client until it finds the authoritative DNS server for a domain name.
we have 

host machine -> local dns -> root dns -> ns server -> authoritative dns

it gets the ip address from the authoritative dns server and then it sends it back to the local dns server, which caches the result for future queries.
via the path 
authoritative dns -> ns server -> root -> local -> host

there are alot of entries

A record     - it is in the authoritative server - mapping between the ip and the hostname
NS record    - 
CNAME record - canonical name
MX record    - 

we will use a software called BIND

authoritative server with
primary, secondary

we have to set a TTL using bind 

master slave configuration
 - used when we have multiple internet connections and authoritative servers
 - the slaves will have a read only copy of the database
 - if the master goes down the slaves can still respond to queries  
 - the slaves will periodically check with the master for updates and sync their data accordingly

we have to run one webserver on one of the VMs and add that record to the authoritative server
make it accessible from the other VMs
it should be master slave


we maybe asked to delete some entry and show them the failure etc
