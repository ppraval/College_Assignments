in red hat go to system settings the network and then click on new and then add the eth1 
set the ip addresses to static and assign eth0 ip addresses to the routers from subnet 1 172.16.20.64/28


I don't know what to do about the vSwitch0


In addition to configuring the static routes, you must enable IP forwarding on both routers.
sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward
sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

router 1
route add -net 172.16.20.96 netmask 255.255.255.240 gw 172.16.20.66  # Subnet 3 via Router 2
route add -net 172.16.20.112 netmask 255.255.255.240 gw 172.16.20.67 # Subnet 4 via Router 3

router 2
route add -net 172.16.20.80 netmask 255.255.255.240 gw 172.16.20.65  # Subnet 2 via Router 1
route add -net 172.16.20.112 netmask 255.255.255.240 gw 172.16.20.67 # Subnet 4 via Router 3

router 3
route add -net 172.16.20.80 netmask 255.255.255.240 gw 172.16.20.65  # Subnet 2 via Router 1
route add -net 172.16.20.96 netmask 255.255.255.240 gw 172.16.20.66  # Subnet 3 via Router 2

command to show tables
route -n
(or)
ip route show

to restart the network
service network restart


We have to install a Router Daemon
download frr via
https://rpm.frrouting.org/

export FRRVER=frr-9
curl -O https://rpm.frrouting.org/repo/$FRRVER-repo-1-0.el9.noarch.rpm
rpm -ivh ./frr-9-repo-1-0.el9.noarch.rpm


exact problem but on a docker

https://superuser.com/questions/476195/how-can-i-install-software-in-linux-with-no-yum-and-no-wget


look at this
https://netref.soe.ucsc.edu/node/22

might have to install this as gpt says this is there
https://www.unix.com/man_page/redhat/8/routed/
smt that i found out online
https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=routed&sektion=8


mount disk3 in redhat
mount the drive 
and in the mounted drive
/mnt/cdrom/Redhat/RPMS
find the <routed .rpm file>
run 
rpm -ivh ./<routed .rpm file>


enable ip forwarding on all routers

and then enter
routed - to start the service
service routed start
service routed status

but i am guessing that we have to run it using
routed -s (force routers to advertise)

apparently there is a firewall that is blocking udp port no 520 which RIP uses anta maari - found at this link https://www.networkurge.com/2020/05/rip-version2.html
i found this out by using
iptables -L -v -n
look at this tmr

on a side note maybe read this
https://www.examcollection.com/certification-training/ccnp-configure-verify-and-troubleshoot-ripv2.html

so how to set up RIP - run these on all routers
sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
iptables -I RH-Lokkit-0-50-INPUT -p udp --dport 520 -j ACCEPT
routed -s

use route -n to check the tables


pfSense time
download the iso file somewhere
then
in the VM's General Settings type 
select 
BSD and then FreeBSD (64-bit)
then go to system and check
Enable I/O APIC box
also give the VM two network cards, one in NAT and the other in intent
ensure it has atleast 5 gb of disk space

in the pfSense ZFS configuration
Pool Type/Disks select 
stripe  disk
and in Select virtual Device type
stripe - NO redundancy
then hit space to select ada0 in VBOX Harddisk
and go back and install
click Yes on to overwrite ada0

force unmount the pfSense .iso file 
then restart the machine

to assign interfaces
WAN interface le0
LAN interface le1
Optional Interface skip for now

then select 2 for setting assigning ip addresses for interfaces

then for LAN assign static ip after skipping by typing n DHCP to assign ip
192.168.1.1/24
then assign more IP addreses in that range for a network
.2/24 subnet and range from .3/24 till .10/24

and then yes for DHCP for LAN
revert to HTTP as the webConfig

right now looking at pfSense
for installation

https://kennethnnorom.com/how-to-configure-firewall-rules-on-pfsense/
https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/recipes/dynamic-routing-basics.html


maybe read through this at some point in time
https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/packages/frr/index.html

in another VM (ubuntu)
set it to the same intent as the pfSense machine and then in the ubuntu go to 
http://192.168.1.1/
user: admin
pwd: pfsense

might have to update the pfSense machine using
pkg update -f

in the pfSense web portal install the frr package
then

read through this
https://blog.matrixpost.net/set-up-dynamic-routing-with-frr-free-range-routing-in-pfsense-openbgpd-now-depricated/
https://pfsense-docs.netlify.app/packages/routing-information-protocol-rip

enable frr in FRR Global on all routers
while setting WAN and LAN
le0 -
le1 - 
these are /28 subnets don't forget - wasted too much time due to this
disable firewalls by unchecking two boxes
scrolling down in the WAN and LAN setup pages in the reserved networks section

set password for frr
i set the password to = iam (don't forget this)
and restart both the pfsense vm and the ubuntu vm

don't forget to change the FRR > RIP advertisements addresses
put both addresses i.e
for router 1
172.16.20.64/28
172.16.20.80/28
also enable redistribute connected networks

add rules in firewall's WAN via Firewall > Rules > Add
to allow udp traffic on port 520 with this we can advertise
to allow all icmp traffic 

netstat -rn (command to check tables in pfSense's shell)

hopefully OSPF is more straight forward
time for OSPF oh boy
look at this for the firewall rules
https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/packages/frr/ospf/example.html
https://forum.netgate.com/topic/28998/ospf-and-firewall-rules (worthless)

OSPF is the practically the same as RIP
disable FRR RIP
enable FRR OSPF
Check redistribute connected networks
add the networks 
for router 1
172.16.20.64/28 area 0.0.0.0
172.16.20.80/28 area 0.0.0.0
add rules in firewall's WAN via Firewall > Rules > Add
to allow all OSPF traffic on any port
check routing tables - via netstat -rn
