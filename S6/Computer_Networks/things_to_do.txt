okay so, what we are supposed to do here is we have 4 virtual switches, vSwitch0, vSwitch1, vSwitch2, vSwitch3
and we have our three routers connected to vSwitch0, so allocate the first subnet to the network connected to vSwitch0, i.e in the subnet 172.16.20.64/28 i need to give the vSwitch the network address, router 1, router 2, router 3 other addresses in the subnet

each of these routers then have their respective vSwitches, i.e
router 1 is connected to vSwitch1 router 2 is connected to vSwitch2 and router 3 is connected to vSwitch3
we also have 3 end point machines which are end_point_1, end_point_2, end_point_2 connected to vSwitch1, vSwitch2, vSwitch3 respectively, so the remaining 3 subnets that we get form the 170.16.20.64/26
i.e not including 172.16.20.64/28
allocate these devices i.e the routers and the machines ip addresses in their respective subnets
also tell me how to allocate each of them in my machines and also how to make those routes

i.e i wanna communicate between end_point_1 and end_point_3
via the route
end_point_1 to vSwitch1 to router_1 to vSwitch0 to router_3 to vSwitch2 to end_point_3
similarly from all end_points to all other end_points via a similar route
